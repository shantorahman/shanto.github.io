<h1> HIS EARLY LIFE </h1>
<p> <b> <i> <big> His parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who would frequently travel to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers – coached by his father, Stuart Underwood and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990. He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.</big> </i> </b>  </p>

In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score.

In September 1994, Beckham went on to gain his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage.

<dd> <ol> <li> David Beckham is one of the world’s biggest star, not just in the world of soccer. He’s a top entrepreneur, an ambassador, underwear model and actor, and eventually the owner of an MLS franchise (we think).

But first and foremost, Beckham was a footballer, and a brilliant one at that. And while "Becks" possessed a variety of skills, he’s really always been known for one thing: free kicks.

Beckham mastered the art of set pieces like few before or after him and his bending free kick goals quickly became his calling card. The England and Man United legend scored a whopping 65 free kick goals over his 20-year career, accounting for half of his career total of 129. As he celebrates his 41st birthday on Monday, let’s revisit his most memorable ones.</li>
